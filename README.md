# Android-projects
consists of all the android projects where I learnt the core concepts of Android and implemented them in small applications

1) Clean2 - It is a prototype to my smart garbage collector application in which i implemented local database using Sqlite and Content Provider, Content Resolver and other animators,intents.

2) Database -  It is an application which represents data in different graphs like(Bar chart, Scatter-Plotter chart, Line chart, Pie chart, radar chart) using libraries(MpCharts) and animations. This application is further extended in stock android app(present in another repository) which compares stock-ticker values using graphs.

3) Dummy Facebook/Twitter App - This is a dummy application just created with the aim of using Content Resolver so as to obtain the data from Dark Knight application where Content Provider is used and display in list.

4) Dark Knight - This is the first(learning purpose) android application which is based on catching Joker(animated character from batman) and saving records in realtime databases. I have implemented andorid concepts like Boradcast Receiver, Intents, Shared Preferences, Menu, animators, layouts, Content Provider, GSON libraries, Views etc. in this app. It consists of 3 applications on this repository namely -- FirstAndroidApp_5, DummyFacebookApp, DummyTwitterApp.
